## Step 1: Launch Advanced Renamer 3.84 Commercial Crack Portable
 
After downloading the program, extract the ZIP file and run the executable file. You will see the main interface of Advanced Renamer, which consists of four panels: Add, List, Batch Mode, and Rename.
 
## Step 2: Add Files or Folders to Rename
 
To add files or folders to rename, you can use the Add button on the toolbar or drag and drop them from Windows Explorer. You can also use the Add menu to add files from subfolders, add folders as names, or add files by using a CSV file.
 
You will see the files or folders added to the List panel, where you can view their current name, new name, path, size, date, and other information. You can also sort, filter, or select them by using the buttons on the toolbar.
 
## Step 3: Choose a Batch Mode and a Method
 
To choose a batch mode, you can use the Batch Mode panel on the right side of the interface. There are eight different batch modes available: New Name, New Case, Remove / Delete, Replace, Add / Insert, List Replace, Attributes / Timestamps, and Script.
 
Each batch mode has its own methods for renaming files or folders. For example, if you choose New Name as the batch mode, you can use methods such as **New Name**, **Re-numbering**, **Trim**, **Swap**, **Move**, **Split Name**, **Merge Name**, etc.
 
To choose a method, you can use the drop-down menu on the Batch Mode panel or click on the Add button to add a new method. You can also edit or remove an existing method by using the buttons on the toolbar.
 
Each method has its own settings that you can customize according to your needs. For example, if you choose New Name as the method, you can enter a new name pattern using tags such as ``, ``, ``, etc. You can also use regular expressions or wildcards for more advanced renaming.
 
## Step 4: Preview and Apply the Rename
 
To preview the rename, you can use the Rename panel at the bottom of the interface. You will see how the new name will look like for each file or folder in the List panel. You can also use the buttons on the toolbar to undo or redo changes, copy names to clipboard, save names to file, etc.
 
If you are satisfied with the preview, you can apply the rename by clicking on the Start Batch button on the toolbar or pressing F9. You will see a progress window showing how many files or folders have been renamed successfully or failed.
